# Obligo

## Motivation
My family struggles ensuring everyone gets their obligations done. I decided to make this as a small project to sharpen my skills with the MERN tech stack 
but this quickly turned into a huge project. I learned so much throughout the process.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
1. Node.js for asynchronous backend operations
2. Express.js as a framework for Node and setting up cron jobs, middleware,and more
3. MongoDB as my cloud based database

### Frontend
1. React for its user compatability and efficient state management
2. Next.js as the React framework as it simplified a lot of things
